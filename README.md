# Welcome to Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course!
- This repository seeks to provide weekly exercises for students to complete on their own in addition to their treehouse work.
- This work is in no way mandatory, it simply seeks to supplement the required Treehouse work and provide simple quick exercises to complete in class as a group
- Feel free to complete these exercises at your own pace, or follow along in class!
- And most importantly, don't forget to ask questions! That's why your mentors are there!
