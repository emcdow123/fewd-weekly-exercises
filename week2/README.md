# Exercise one: Create a simple HTML page!
Now that you know Git, lets make some use of it! Last week we created a simple HTML file that's going to be the basis of our site, now, we're going to move this file into a repository in git!

To start, we're going to fork an existing "skeleton" project to do our exercises in, we don't want to rely on web based editors, we want to do our work locally on our machines and leverage git and GitHub!

Go here, and look for the option to fork this project: https://github.com/emcdow123/fewd-skeleton/tree/v1.2

Once you've forked this project, you should have a copy of it in your own GitHub profile, feel free to go there, change the name of the project, and then be sure to pull the project down to your local machine so we can make changes to it!

After you've pulled the project down to your local machine, open the folder in your preferred text editor and add the HTML that you created in last weeks exercise to the index.html file. (If you don't have this, refer to this pin to get the html code: https://codepen.io/emcdow123/pen/POpoNy)

Commit this updated code and push it to your GitHub account. You've now successfully created and push a commit to a remote git repository!
